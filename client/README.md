# Frontend Application

A modern React frontend application built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - Component-based JavaScript library to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **MSAL** - Microsoft Authentication Library for secure user authentication
- **Redux Toolkit** - Global state management with simplified Redux logic
- **RTK Query** - Powerful data fetching and caching solution built on Redux Toolkit
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **shadcn/ui** - High-quality component library for consistent theming and styling

## Development

The application leverages modern React patterns with hooks and functional @/components. State management is handled through Redux Toolkit for global state, while RTK Query manages server state and API interactions efficiently.

Authentication flows are implemented using MSAL for seamless integration with Microsoft identity services. The UI is built with a combination of Tailwind's utility classes and shadcn/ui @/components for a consistent and professional appearance.
